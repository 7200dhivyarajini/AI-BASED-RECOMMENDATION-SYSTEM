**DESCRIPTION**:

### **AI-Based Recommendation System**  

#### **Objective**  
Develop a recommendation system using Java and libraries like Apache Mahout to suggest products or content based on user preferences. The system should analyze user behavior and generate personalized recommendations.  

#### **Tasks & Descriptions**  

1. **Understand Recommendation System Concepts**  
   - Study collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques.  
   - Choose an appropriate approach for the project.  

2. **Set Up Java Development Environment**  
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  
   - Configure Maven or Gradle for dependency management.  

3. **Integrate Apache Mahout**  
   - Add Apache Mahout as a dependency to the project.  
   - Understand Mahout’s algorithms for recommendation generation.  

4. **Prepare Sample Data**  
   - Collect or create sample user interaction data (e.g., product ratings, viewing history).  
   - Store the data in a CSV file or database for easy processing.  

5. **Implement the Recommendation Engine**  
   - Use Mahout’s collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques.  
   - Train the system using sample data and generate recommendations.  

6. **Optimize and Tune the Model**  
   - Adjust parameters to improve recommendation accuracy.  
   - Evaluate performance using precision-recall metrics.  

7. **Display Recommendations**  
   - Print recommended products or content in a structured format in the console.  
   - Optionally, create a simple GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX for a better user experience.  

8. **Error Handling & Logging**  
   - Implement exception handling for missing data, incorrect input formats, and processing errors.  
   - Use logging (e.g., `java.util.logging` or `SLF4J`) for debugging and monitoring.  

9. **Test the Application**  
   - Validate recommendations by testing with different user inputs.  
   - Ensure system robustness and accuracy.  

#### **Deliverable**  
A Java program that:  
- Uses Apache Mahout to generate personalized recommendations.  
- Processes and analyzes sample user data.  
- Displays relevant recommendations in a structured format.  
- Includes proper error handling and logging.  
- Optionally provides a GUI for improved usability.
